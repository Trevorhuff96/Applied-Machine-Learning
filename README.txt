This paper and project addresses the challenge of accurately predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning; specifically, how sample frequency and feature engineering impact model accuracy. Accurately predicting Bitcoin price is challenging due to the following reasons: inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, its susceptibility to social factors, and the elusive nature of Bitcoin. Current research often focuses on achieving high prediction accuracy while overlooking the impact of different feature sets and modeling techniques. This aligns with the problem highlighted by Chen et al. (2020), who notes that few studies focus on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with varying data structures and dimensional features for Bitcoin price prediction
